# Remote Meetup App Status

## Project Overview
A Next.js application that allows users to create and join remote meetups, with features like:
- User authentication (signup/login) using Appwrite
- Meetup creation and management
- Map visualization using Mapbox
- Real-time location tracking

## Current Status
- ✅ Basic authentication flow implemented
- ✅ Meetup CRUD operations working
- ✅ Map integration functional
- ✅ TypeScript types properly defined
- ✅ Error handling implemented

## Recent Updates
- Added proper TypeScript types for all components
- Implemented error handling across the application
- Fixed type issues with Appwrite integration
- Added proper form event handling

## Guidelines for Future Development

### For AI Assistants
1. **Maintain Type Safety**
   - All new code must maintain TypeScript type safety
   - Use proper type assertions only when necessary
   - Don't remove existing type definitions

2. **Error Handling**
   - Preserve the established error handling patterns
   - Always type check caught errors
   - Maintain user-friendly error messages

3. **Component Structure**
   - Keep the current component hierarchy
   - Maintain separation of concerns
   - Don't modify working component interfaces

4. **API Integration**
   - Preserve Appwrite integration patterns
   - Maintain existing database schema
   - Don't modify working API endpoints

### Important Note
When implementing new features or fixing issues:
- Test changes thoroughly
- Don't break existing functionality
- Maintain consistent error handling
- Preserve type safety
- Document significant changes

## Next Steps
- [ ] Implement real-time updates for meetups
- [ ] Add user profiles
- [ ] Enhance map interactions
- [ ] Add meetup categories
